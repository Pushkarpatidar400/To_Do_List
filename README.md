# To-Do List Manager
A simple To-Do List Manager where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The user also has the option to view tasks filtered by their completion and non completion status using python with Flask Framework which is running on server http://127.0.0.1:5000/ .

Functionalities :-
1. Enable users to add new tasks with a description and due date.
